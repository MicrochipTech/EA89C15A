# Notice

The Early Access program for SAMA7D65 is now over.

The Early Access SAMA7D65 Curiosity kit (EA89C15A) has now been superseded by the production [SAMA7D65 Curiosity kit (EV63J76A)](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV63J76A). 

We recommend referring to [SAMA7D65](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/SAMA7D65) and [SAMA7D65D2G](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/SAMA7D65D2G) product pages, and to the production [SAMA7D65 Curiosity kit](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV63J76A) for the most up-to-date information.

# SAMA7D65 SoC/SiP Early Access - Repository

The SAMA7D6 Series is a high-performance Arm® Cortex®-A7 CPU-based embedded microprocessor (MPU) targeting HMI and connectivity applications in the home/building, industrial, appliance, medical & automotive markets.
The SAMA7D6 Series is delivered with a comprehensive development suite that includes a mainline Linux® distribution and the Microchip MPLAB® X/Harmony software framework.
Running at up to 1 GHz, the device offers support for multiple memories, such as 16-bit DDR2, DDR3, DDR3L, LPDDR2, LPDDR3, octal/quad SPI Flash. It integrates various display interfaces, including MIPI DSI®, LVDS and 8-bit Serial RGB.
The SAMA7D6 Series features connectivity options such as a dual 10/100/1000 Ethernet MAC with TSN support, five CAN-FD, three high-speed USB interfaces and embeds advanced security functions, such as PUF, secure boot, secure key storage and high-performance crypto accelerators for AES, SHA, RSA and ECC.
